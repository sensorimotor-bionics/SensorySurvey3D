# Sensory Survey 3D Bionic Breast Annotation Viewer

Bionic Breast Annotation Viewer is a Python notebook which parses files generated by the Sensory Survey 3D app. It is intended for viewing and reviewing sensory data collected during brain-computer interface studies.

## Running

The Bionic Breast Annotation Viewer should install its own dependencies.

List the Survey3D json files that you wish to review in annotation_paths (or glob the appropriate folder for the relevant files), noting which electrode each describes in the electrodes array. Ensure the model files referenced in your Survey3D files (i.e. Chest-PostOp.glb.json or Chest-PreOp.glb.json) are also findable/in the path.

Bionic Breast Annotation Viewer will iterate over all electrodes to plot all documented projected field maps as vertex color maps over the relevant mesh, averaging across multiple maps associated with a single electrode.

## Google Colab

The notebook is also accessible via colab at this url: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WRCZgqTnejCmzGzLWf44Sb3NA1Bj1x7M?usp=sharing

If using the notebook via colab, make sure to upload the relevant json files to colab prior to running.
